The project uses the popular Towers of Hanoi puzzle to demonstrate recursion. It allows the user to either solve the puzzle themselves, or let the program compute a solution for them.

## Functionality
The program uses three rods to simulate the Towers of Hanoi game. It takes as input the number of disks, and then presents the user with the choice of either having the computer solve the puzzle, or letting the user solve it manually. When the user selects manual mode, they are given instructions on how to play, and they must move all disks from the first rod to the third rod using the second rod as a temporary space. The program checks each move to make sure it is valid before executing it, and keeps track of the number of moves the user has made. The game ends when all disks have been moved to the third rod.

## Technologies
This program was implemented in Java, and doesn't require any external libraries.
